                <div class="heading first">HABITAT</div>
                <p>Most shrimp live on the seafloor of the ocean, and in lakes and rivers. Nearly all species of shrimp are aquatic, with the exception of the <a href="#funfacts">Merguia rhizophorae</a></p>

                <div class="heading space">DIET</div>
                <p>Shrimp eat nearly anything, and since they're omnivores, they'll eat plants and animals. Some things they eat include algae, dead and living plants, and snails</p>

                <div class="heading space">APPEARANCE</div>
                <p>They're classified as crustaceans, and are mostly divided into three sections, the head, thorax, and abdomen. They have a tail, ten pairs of legs, eyes, and a rostrum, but body structure varies in different species of shrimp</p>
